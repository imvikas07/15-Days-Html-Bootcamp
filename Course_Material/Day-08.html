In HTML, elements are classified into two main categories: inline and block-level elements. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for structuring and styling web pages effectively.

### 1. Inline Elements:
Inline elements are those that only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element and do not start on a new line. They typically appear within block-level elements.

Examples of inline elements:
- `<span>`
- `<a>`
- `<strong>`
- `<em>`
- `<img>`
- `<input>`

**Demonstration:**
```html
<p>This is a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> text.</p>
```
In this example, the `<span>` element is inline and used to change the color of the word "blue" within the paragraph.

### 2. Block-Level Elements:
Block-level elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them, pushing subsequent content downwards. They can contain other block-level and inline elements.

Examples of block-level elements:
- `<div>`
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
- `<table>`, `<form>`

**Demonstration:**
```html
<div style="background-color: lightgray; padding: 10px;">
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a block-level <code>div</code>.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph inside the same block-level <code>div</code>.</p>
</div>
```
Here, the `<div>` element is block-level and contains two paragraphs, each starting on a new line.

### Key Differences:
1. **Layout Behavior**:
   - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only occupy the space bounded by their tags.
   - Block-level elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them.

2. **Nested Elements**:
   - Inline elements can be nested within other inline elements or block-level elements.
   - Block-level elements can contain other block-level and inline elements.

3. **Default Styling**:
   - Inline elements are often used for styling portions of text or embedding content within a line of text.
   - Block-level elements are often used for grouping content, creating structure, or applying styles that affect entire sections of a page.

Understanding the distinction between inline and block-level elements is essential for proper HTML document structure and CSS styling. This knowledge enables web developers to effectively manipulate and design layouts according to their requirements.
