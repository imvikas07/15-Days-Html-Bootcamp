Sure, let's break down HTML forms and form attributes step by step, and I'll provide a simple demonstration along the way.

### HTML Forms:

HTML forms are used to collect user input. They can contain various types of input elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc. The `<form>` tag is used to create a form in HTML.

### Basic Structure of a Form:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Form</title>
</head>
<body>

    <form>
        <!-- Form elements go here -->
    </form>

</body>
</html>
```

### Form Attributes:

1. **action**: Specifies the URL where the form data will be sent.
2. **method**: Specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data. Common values are "GET" and "POST".
3. **name**: Specifies a name for the form.
4. **target**: Specifies where to display the response after submitting the form.
5. **autocomplete**: Specifies whether a form should have autocomplete enabled or disabled.
6. **enctype**: Specifies how form data should be encoded when submitting it to the server. Common values are "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and "multipart/form-data".

### Example Demonstration:

Let's create a simple form that takes input for a username and password.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Login Form</title>
</head>
<body>

    <form action="/login" method="post">
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required><br><br>
        
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required><br><br>
        
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
    </form>

</body>
</html>
```

Explanation:
- The `<form>` tag creates a form.
- `action="/login"` specifies that when the form is submitted, the data will be sent to the `/login` endpoint on the server.
- `method="post"` indicates that the form data will be sent via an HTTP POST request.
- `<label>` tags are used to create labels for the input fields.
- `<input type="text">` creates a text input field for the username.
- `<input type="password">` creates a password input field for the password. Note that the characters entered in this field are masked for security.
- `required` attribute makes both fields mandatory.
- `<input type="submit">` creates a submit button. When clicked, it submits the form data.

This is a basic example to get you started with HTML forms. Forms can be much more complex and versatile, but this should give you a solid foundation to build upon.
