 In HTML, input forms are used to collect information from users. There are various types of input forms that you can use depending on the type of data you want to collect. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Text Input:
   `<input type="text" name="username">`

   This creates a single-line text input field where users can enter text, such as their name or a short message.

2. Password Input:
   `<input type="password" name="password">`

   This creates a text input field where the characters are masked to hide the actual input. It's commonly used for password fields.

3. Email Input:
   `<input type="email" name="email">`

   This creates a text input field specifically designed for entering email addresses. It includes validation to ensure that the input follows the format of an email address.

4. Number Input:
   `<input type="number" name="quantity">`

   This creates a text input field that only accepts numeric values. You can also specify a range of acceptable values using the `min` and `max` attributes.

5. Checkbox:
   `<input type="checkbox" name="subscribe" value="yes">`

   This creates a checkbox that users can select or deselect. It's commonly used for options where users can choose multiple items from a list.

6. Radio Button:
   ```
   <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male
   <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female
   ```

   This creates a set of radio buttons where users can select only one option from the list. They are commonly used for questions with mutually exclusive options.

7. Textarea:
   `<textarea name="message" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>`

   This creates a multi-line text input field where users can enter longer messages or comments.

8. Select Dropdown:
   ```
   <select name="country">
       <option value="usa">USA</option>
       <option value="uk">UK</option>
       <option value="canada">Canada</option>
   </select>
   ```

   This creates a dropdown menu where users can select one option from a list. It's commonly used for selecting options from a predefined set.

These are just some of the basic input types in HTML. Each type serves a specific purpose and can be customized further using attributes such as `required`, `placeholder`, `disabled`, etc., to tailor the form to your specific needs. Feel free to experiment with these inputs to get a better understanding of how they work.
